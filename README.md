# termfilter
A simple Drupal module to create a filter for input format, turning all term in selected vocab into links to the taxonomy view page.

This is a simpler version of Drupal Glossify module. I created this module without knowing the existence of Glossify. 
This module is finished in both Durpal 7 and Drupal 8. It is mainly used by me for Drupal presentations, as I see it a good example to demostrate the difference between D7 and D8 module development.
For production use, I suggest to check on Glossify as it is maintained in drupal.org.
